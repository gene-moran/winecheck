    <h1>WineCheck Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2026</p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>WineCheck ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle information when you use our wine scanning application.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Camera Access:</strong> WineCheck uses your device's camera solely to scan wine labels. Images are processed temporarily and are not stored on our servers.</p>
    <p><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect, store, or share any personal information such as your name, email address, or location.</p>
    
    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Wine label images are sent to our AI service (OpenAI) for analysis. This processing is done in real-time, and images are not retained after the analysis is complete.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use OpenAI's API to analyze wine labels. OpenAI's privacy policy applies to data processed through their service.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All data transmission is encrypted using industry-standard HTTPS protocols.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>WineCheck is intended for users of legal drinking age. We do not knowingly collect information from minors.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>
